Definitely Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga

Pressing enter on the start screen progresses to the main game.

Here there is a principal objective of reaching Mario, who is separated from you by Spinies.

The optional objective is to stomp and defeat goombas. There is no extra purpose other than intrinsic satsfaction (and the counter going up).

If the player touches a spiny, the game will be lost and it will transition to a lose screen. From here, the player can press backspace to return to the main menu.

If the player touches Mario, the game will progress to a win screen.

Good luck.
